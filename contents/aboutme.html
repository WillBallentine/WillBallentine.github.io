            I'm Will Ballentine, a developer who loves to write beautifully effective code that 
            not only accomplishes the job, but looks good in the process. Python, SQL, and
            the front-end suite are what I have spent my time mastering but I am always up for
            a learning challenge. Take a look through my site and some of the projects I have 
            worked on. See something you like? Let me know! Don't see something you wish you
            did? Let me know that too!
